=> To Do
- Fix issue with internal date when restored on an account
- Add support for compression in the imap communication
- Send a fix for that to the imap guy and add a way to STORE esoteric keywords like the ones in GMAIL
- Optimize storage on metadata file

=> Thinking

- First element synching with a account against the database
=> the database needs an index file for each month directory
=> each email should also have a metadata file that contains => header info and the data file
=> 2 syncing ways => checking info such as labels mainly and syncing only data


Next Steps:
- start packaging
- start building the command line (full sync, incremental sync, mirror)
- Add proper logging

Commandline:
gmvault --sync --imap-server --login --passwd --db-dir 
gmvault --sync --imap-server --oauth-token --db-dir
gmvault --inc-sync --imap-server --oauth-token --db-dir
gmvault --quick-sync --imap-server --oauth-token --db-dir

gmvault --restore --imap-server --login --passwd --db-dir 
gmvault --restore --imap-server --oauth-token --db-dir

gmvault --mirror --type=s3 --token

NEXT => add restore mode,
     => add mirror mode,
     => create gui
     
     
 
strategy reconnect retry abort ?

Apparently it seems to be some corrupted messages (http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=1acf74d2c4c1ed46&hl=en)
This is worrying but the message should be flagged and maybe deleted later one.
Let's see. In any case, the exception needs to be catched in 

When Id is retrieved it is working. The problem is there when the data is retrieved


To Do 22-12-2012:
-----------------
- sync_delete can be redone as all the gm_id are retrieved from the filesystem at once 
(test if it scales)
=> instead of iterating on the remote gmail ids, iterate (with generator) by group of 30 elements on the
disk saved ids. This should scale for ever whatever the number of you have
- Test disconnection and see what is going on (error generated)
- Potentially add a reconnection mode (try to reconect 3 times before to quit)
- Add a way to restart from an imap id. Could be used when you have a very large mailbox and 
want to restart from the moment when it failed.
- add logging now otherwise it might be too late
- test why labels cannot be hierarchically recreated
- add oauth and a way to save the token.
- manage a .gmvault dir in your home
- add progress bar and better logging outputs with verbose and non verbose mode
- release v0.5 
- add cloud saves
- add Mac Gui, Linux or chrome GUI


Maybe redo the sync_delete as all the gm id are retrieve from filesystem (see if it scales)
