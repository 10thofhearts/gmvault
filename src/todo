DOING:
------

1) Add default DB that is built from the email

We could have it by default depending on email but how is it going to work with the multi owned repositories.

First a default should be created from the conf
default_gmvault_db=GMV$EMAIL%DEF # this is the default to use email
default_gmvault_db=gmvault-db # this is the default to use email
